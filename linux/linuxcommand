To see the list of installed packages, use this command:
apt list --installed

To see how many entries there are, we can pipe through wc, as we did before.
apt list --installed | wc -l

To investigate a single package, use the apt show command with the name of the package.
apt show xml-core

Using dpkg Package Manager:
dpkg --get-selections | grep "code"

Another way is to use the dpkg-query tool:
dpkg-query -l

Using Flatpak:
flatpak list --app

To know where the installed package is stored:
sudo dpkg -L code
